<summary>What's in each branch of this project?</summary>

 Branch | Description 
 --- | ---
 `main` | Where all development occurs
 `001-stateless` | A decent little clickable grid (bad on mobile)
 `002-list-lookup-state` | Grid toggle is refactored to use state
 `003-bool-array-state` | Grid state is improved

</details>

Develop on the project on any given branch:

```sh
npm i
npm run watch
open http://localhost:8280/
```

The project is not meant to be built manually but it can be done with `npm run release`.

I am working on a unique CI/CD workflow using branches instead of releases. All development occurs on `main`. A branch is created at any milestone which will publish IN PARALLEL to all other branches. I use numerical prefixes which is ultimately arbitrary.

Currently I need to work on custom formatting indices and page navigation, then the effect will work. I want a visitor to step through live builds to see the progress and if interested, read my thoughts on them. Some ideas are using a template parser (i.e [selmer, included in babashka](https://book.babashka.org/#built-in-namespaces), which could be run from the repo or [in an action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-clojure)), or scraping the existing live pages and forcing in new dom nodes.

**For now, view the main branch here:** [hardly.link/projects/d02-grip/](https://hardly.link/projects/d02-grip/)

What is this list formatting? Iâ€™m trying out a style of list [I wrote about adapting here](https://www.are.na/block/17704579). It's an informal and currently manual notation for managing projects that are too small to need some grand kanban deck.
